# Bemuseâ€™s release train

Archived.

This is a script that creates a PR that merges many PRs into one. This helps with keeping the main branch as stable as possible. [See the docs that explains the merging process](https://github.com/bemusic/bemuse/blob/9ae9513826385ebf71ddbc14ac4443648bf36234/website/docs/workflows.md).

**As of 2022, this is no longer used.** It is now replaced by an workflow inspired by [changesets/action](https://github.com/changesets/action), and the implementation lives on the Bemuse repository directly.
